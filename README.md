# London Underground Commute Analysis (Chart)
Tool that allows user to compare different stations' commuter traffic throughout the day. Implemented in python

Charts created using matplotlib (pyplot)

To invoke program: 'python ldn_underground_info.py'

When prompted, if you would like to see a list of all stations on record, enter 'y'.

Afterwards, you can do one of two things
1) Enter names of stations that you would like to compare. Then type 'done' when finished. 5 stations at most can be compared to prevent making the output look 'clunky'
2) Type 'busiest 5' to generate a chart comparing the 5 busiest stations on that day

Some sample output can be seen in the images below
TODO: Add screenshots

If you would like to save the image, when prompted, type 'y'.
